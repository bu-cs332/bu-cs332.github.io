            <p>
                This course is an introduction to the theory of computation. This is the branch of computer science that aims to understand which problems can be solved using computational devices and how efficiently those problems can be solved. To be able to make precise statements and rigorous arguments, computational devices are modeled using abstract mathematical "models of computation." The learning objectives of the course are to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Foremost, understand how to rigorously reason about computation through the use of abstract, formal models.</li>
                <li> Learn the definitions of several specific models of computation including finite automata, context-free grammars, and Turing machines, learn tools for analyzing their power and limitations, and understand how they are used in other areas of computer science.</li>
                <li> Learn how fundamental philosophical questions about the nature of computation (Are there problems which cannot be solved by computers? Can every problem for which we can quickly verify a solution also be solved efficiently?) can be formalized as precise mathematical problems.</li>
                <li> Gain experience with creative mathematical problem solving and develop the ability to write correct, clear, and concise mathematical proofs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Teaching Format</h3>
            
            <p>
                The teaching will follow the Learn <i>from</i> Anywhere (L<i>f</i>A) policy, allowing both in-person and remote students.
                We will experiment with different methods of teaching, including lecturing, recorded lecturing, flipped class, problem solving in class.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We will the use Top Hat response system for questions during the lectures.
                You will be able to submit answers to in-class questions using Apple or Android smartphones and tablets, laptops, or through text message.
            </p>
            
            <p>
You can visit the Top Hat Overview (Top-Hat-Overview-and-Getting-Started-Guide) within the Top Hat Success Center which outlines how you will register for a Top Hat account, as well as providing a brief overview to get you up and running on the system.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finally, all class announcements will be made through Piazza, so please set your notifications appropriately.
                Please post questions about the course material to Piazza instead of emailing the course staff directly. It is likely that other students will have the same questions as you and may be able to provide answers in a more timely fashion. Active participation on Piazza may add extra points to your participation grade.
            </p>

                Reading the textbook before class and reviewing it after class are important for solidifying your understanding of the course material. However, I do not want the exhorbitant price of the book to pose a barrier to your learning. Using an older edition of the text is fine (though beware that section numbers may be different). If the cost of the textbook still presents a burden for you, let me know and I can loan you a copy or recommend another solution.

            Your grade in the course will be determined by homework assignments, three in-class exams, and class participation. <br>

            The following letter grades are guaranteed if you earn the corresponding percentages: A ≥93%, A- ≥90%, B+ ≥87%, B ≥83%, B- ≥80%, C+ ≥75%, C ≥70%. However, to correct for the possibility of assignments and exams being more difficult than anticipated, letter grades may be (significantly) increased above these guarantees based on the overall performance of the class.


            <h3>
            Homework (30%)
            </h3>

            <p>There will be weekly homework assignments to be submitted on Gradescope every Tuesday at 2PM. No late homework will be accepted. To accomodate extenuating circumstances, your two lowest homework grades will be dropped. 
            </p>

            <p>You are allowed, and indeed encouraged, to collaborate with other students on solving the homework problems. However, you must write the solutions independently in your own words.
            </p>

            <p>Some homework assignments may include optional "bonus" problems. Solving these problems will not directly contribute to your homework grade but may improve the letter grade you receive in the course if the final percentage we calculate is on the borderline between two letter grades. Solving bonus problems is also a good way to impress your instructor if you are seeking a recommendation letter, research opportunities, or a grading position. Collaboration is NOT allowed on bonus problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are expected to present your homework cleanly so that the graders do not mistakenly take away your points.
                You may want to use LaTeX to typeset your homework solutions. LaTeX is the standard document preparation system used in the mathematical sciences. Using LaTeX makes it easier for you to revise and edit your solutions and for us to read them, so you will never lose points for illegibility. 
            </p>

            <p>
            For LaTeX editors, you can try <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/">TexShop</a> for Mac and <a href="https://www.texstudio.org/">TexStudio</a> for Windows.

            </h3>

            <p>There will be two 70-minute in-class midterm exams scheduled for Monday, Feb. 24 and Wednesday, Apr. 1. <b>These dates are confirmed and are not subject to change.</b> Each midterm will cover roughly one-third of the course content. A comprehensive final exam will be held during the normal two-hour exam slot. Please wait until the official University final exam schedule is finalized before making your end-of-semester travel plans.
            </p>

            <p>You may bring one double-sided 8.5" x 11" sheet of notes to each midterm exam and two such sheets to the final exam. Note sheets may be either handwritten or typeset. You may not use any other aids during the exam, including but not limited to books, lecture notes, calculators, phones, or laptops.

            Class Participation (30%)
            </h3>

            <p>
            Your active participation in class and in discussion sections is an essential part of your learning. Your participation grade will be determined by your engagement with the Top Hat classroom response system. It will also be possible to increase this score by thoughtfully asking and answering questions in lectures, in discussions, on Piazza, or during office hours.

<h3>
Disability Services
</h3>
Students with documented disabilities, including learning disabilities, may be entitled to accommodations intended to ensure that they have integrated and equal access to the academic, social, cultural, and recreational programs the university offers. Accommodations may include, but are not limited to, additional time on tests, staggered homework assignments, note-taking assistance. If you believe you should receive accommodations, please contact the Office of Disability Services to discuss your situation.

<h3>
Grade Grievances 
</h3>
If you feel that you have received an arbitrary grade in a course, you should attempt to meet with the grader before filing a formal appeal. If the student and the instructor are unable to arrive at a mutually agreeable solution, the student may file a formal appeal with the chair. This process must begin within six weeks of the grade posting. To understand how an “arbitrary grade” is defined, please explore the following link.

<h3>
Incomplete Grades
</h3>
An incomplete grade (I) is used only when the student has conferred with the instructor prior to the submission of grades and offered acceptable reasons for the incomplete work. If you wish to take an incomplete in this class, please contact the instructor as soon as possible but certainly before the submission of final grades. To receive an incomplete, you and your instructor must both sign an “Incomplete Grade Report” specifying the terms under which you will complete the class.
